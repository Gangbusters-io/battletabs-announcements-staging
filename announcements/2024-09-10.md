BattleTabs on Discord is also where clans live. There are a growing list of clans already competing for the top spot!

This is a huge milestone for our team and we couldnâ€™t be more excited to bring BattleTabs to the Discord community! ðŸŽ‰ 

Discord has been home to our community for years, and it's one of the most social platforms out there - with the engagement, the fun, and all the extra details on the platform. We've partnered with Discord in the past few months to bring BattleTabs on to Discord Activities - and we are super excited that it's finally here!

Expect more clan features coming to Discord Activities - we are keen to explore the possiblities with this platform. Do check it out!
